It would be wise to understand Resource Utilization Factors (RUF) which is defined as factors applied to the quantity of total energy (latent and sensible) to develop any project. This factor would include all processes such as exploration, mining, refining, transporting, converting raw materials for end use. The critical path of all energy to and from the point of exploration to the completed project should be charted. Independent RUFs are carefully calculated for coal, gas, oil, and electricity which form part of the total energy used for the project. 
Thereby no such thing as "Green Energy" or "Net Zero".
